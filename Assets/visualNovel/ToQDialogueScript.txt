Blank screen, *beep, beep, beep, beep, beep*. *thunk*

*eyes open and see room*

Ahh, *stretch*, hmmm….GAH, I’m late for class!

*rummaging sounds* *all dressed for school, skinny jeans and Tshirt*

*goes downstairs*

Mom: You’re late you know...But here, I made you your smoothie

You: *grabs smoothies and leaves* Morning mom, thanks for the smoothie, see ya!

Mom: Oh honey, did you end up finishing that math…*slam*, sigh, and she’s gone. 

Scene: walking to school, looking at phone

*You are on phone, texting your BFF*

Friend: Hey gurl! Where r u? 1st period is about to start :P

You, texting: Ugh, I pulled an all-nighter last night and I still didn't finish that assignment :( I woke up late, but am on my way now! 

*Sends text* *trips on something*

You: Wahhhhh…. *falls through magical portal*

Black screen, “Meanwhile… 

Scene: Prince, surrounded by 3 goblins

Goblin 1: Well, well, if it isn’t a lost little prince. You’ll fetch a pretty sum. Where are your guards, hmm? You think someone’s just going to fall out of the 
sky and save you now?

*thunk, you fall from the sky and land on goblin*

Goblin 2: Oh...

You: uhh, what happened..? *notices guys in funny outfit and hideous monsters staring at her* WHAT THE...!!!

You: What is going on here! Who are you people, ugh things?! Where am I?

Prince Xander: *reaches out hand* Excuse me, miss. Are you alright?

You: Uhh, I guess so, umm, who are you? 

Goblin3: Look at what you did to our boss! 

Prince: I would love to explain, but I think we have a little situation to deal with first. Your Radian aura…I’ve never seen anything quite like it before.

You: My what???

Prince: Oh my, you must have hit your head harder than I thought. But no time to explain now. Just follow my lead
*battle sequence*

P: Th-that was amazing! Your aura, such power. You really could be the key to saving us all. 

Y: Wait, what, I don’t understand. 

P: Please, come with me, back to my castle. It is not safe out here. I will explain everything to you once we get back.

Y: …But…I don’t know you.

P: So you would rather stay out here, waiting for the goblins’ reinforcements. 

Y: Ok, on second thought, lead the way your highness. 
*goes back to castle*

P: Welcome to my home, Degreeian Castle. Please, make yourself at home. I do apologize for the mess, it has been a while since we’ve had guests. *cut to image of pristine castle interior* 

Y: *thinking to self* This is messy?!

P: But come, let’s go to the study and make ourselves comfortable, while Albert makes us some tea.
*sitting on plush chairs, mugs of tea in hand, Prince begins to tell his tale*

P: First, I wish to hear your story. Who are you, and how did you get here. It is clear from your dress that you are not from this realm. 

Y: My name is ___ and I am from New Town. I am just a normal 15 year old girl I guess. I have a mom, go to school, hang out with friends. I was on my way to school this morning and I was texting my best friend. I guess I wasn’t paying attention to where I was going cause I tripped on something and the next thing I know, I end up here. 

P: …Hmm…fascinating. So you are from another realm? Yes, that could explain the power…You are exactly the hero we need right now. 

Y: Wait, you keep saying power, heroes, what exactly is going on?!

P: Ah yes, I apologize, you have graciously told me your story, so it is only fair that I do the same. First, to answer your first inquiry, Aura is the physical manifestation of the higher mental state induced by arithmetics. There are various classes and abilities and the stronger your Aura is, the more power you have. Only I, and a few others, have the power to defeat enemies as we had done so earlier.  

Y: Right, ok, I guess that makes sense. And what exactly happened with those creature things back there?

P:  Those creatures that we battled before, work for the Dark Lord. You see, centuries ago, the realm was ruled over by two royal families. We, the Axis, ruled the South, while the Vertegios ruled the North. It was a peaceful and prosperous arrangement, the country thrived. But then, the King Vertegio at the time, became greedy. He was consumed by the idea of power and total domination. He didn’t want people to rule over, he wanted mindless servants who obeyed his every order. But my ancestors stood in his way. He started a war, and tried to take the South by force. Many lives were lost in the battles, but in the end, my ancestors managed to defeat him. It took every bot of Aura power they had, but they sealed him away somewhere where he would never be able to harm anyone again. That is until recently. The seal must have been weakened over the centuries, but now, He is back for revenge; to complete his goal all those centuries ago. He has taken up residence in his former homeland in the North. He has been causing trouble in the nearby towns, but nothing major so far. I believe he is trying to get to me first, but I will do everything in my power to ensure that he does not succeed at his ultimate goal.
So, that is why I need your help, __. I am tired of waiting for his attack. I plan to destroy him once and for all, and with you by my side, we can go to his castle and defeat him! I believe you were sent here for a reason. Help me defeat him and I believe that will be the key to getting you back to your world.

Y: ….O_o

P: I understand this is a lot to take in. And you must be weary from your journey. Please, stay the night and rest. You can tell me your answer in the morning. 

Y: Wait, you, you really think this will get me back home? 

P: Yes, I believe so.

Y: Ok, then since I have no other options, I guess I can help you. Who knows, maybe I will even learn something along the way?

P: Excellent! I shall begin the preparations for our journey. I hope you understand that it will just have to be the 2 of us, since any more will attract suspicion and even more monsters than I would like. But please, rest up for tonight. We shall leave tomorrow morning. 

Y: *yawns* Wow, I guess I didn’t realize how tired I was. 

P: The maids will help you get ready. Sleep well, __.

Y: *half asleep* Night, your Highness

*Leaves*

*Changes to next morning, in the guest bedroom of the castle*

Y: *wakes up, yawns* ahh, what a crazy dream, goblins, and Princes and…*opens eyes and rubs them, sees the canopy over bed, plush carpets and large fireplace* Wait, what in the world! This, this is real!? It wasn’t a dream?!
Maid: Miss__, you have awaken. His Highness invites you for breakfast. Your clothes are here. Would you like me to assist you? 

Y: Uhh, no thanks, I got it. Tell his Highness I will be right there. 
*Scene changes to breakfast*

P: Ah, good morning. I hope your rest was well. We shall start our journey after the meal.
*Scene changes to after breakfast, on horses, with bags packed, on the road*

P: All set? Ready to go?

Y: *sigh* Ready as I’ll ever be. 

P: Alright, onwards then!
 *map selection*


The Fractal Forest:

*riding through Forest*

Y: He seems friendly enough, but I don’t know anything about him. Looks not much older than me, but where are his parents? He lives all alone in that huge castle? Well, surrounded by all those butlers and maids, but for some reason, he seems so sad. So, umm, your Highness?

P: Oh, we want to attract as little attention as we can, so we are under the guise of a travelling merchant and his pretty young wife. Call me Xavier. 

Y: Right, Xavier, umm so what do you do for fun around here?

P: Fun? I suppose, any spare time we have, we would be honing our powers, protecting the people. Is that what you mean?

Y: Uhh, sure. Wow, being a teenager here sounds tough…
*rock gets hurled from no where, startles horses, who throw off riders and bolt*

Y: Ahh! 

P: No, the horses! Gah, they’re gone. Are you alright?

Y: Yeah, nothing seems to be broken, but what just happened?

*Goblins step out from bushes*

G: Well, well, if it isn’t our old pals. We heard about you from our buddies yesterday, so we’d thought we would come pay back the favour. 

P: Leave us alone. Your friends got what they deserved.

G: Well, I think it’s about time you got what you deserved!

*battle starts*

*battle ends*

P and Y tired, but still standing.

Y: Are you alright? You were hit pretty badly.

P: I’m fine. It will take a lot more than a hit from a Goblin to kill me.

Y: So where do we go now?

P: There should be an inn up ahead, we should go and rest up. Hopefully we will make it before night falls.

*rest at inn*

*next day*

P: I managed to pursued the innkeeper to sell us 2 of his horses. Unfortunately, we do not have much in terms of food and weapons, but we will be ok. 

Y: Ok, lead the way

*walk through forest*

*hear piercing scream*

Y: What was that!

P: It came from over there! Let’s go, maybe someone needs our help. 

*scene changes, sees an Elf protecting woodland creatures from a Monster*

Monster: Yes, more servants, the master will be pleased.

Elf: Leave those creatures alone! If you want to get to them, you will have to go through me first!

P: STOP! Leave those creatures alone Monster!

M: Mind your own business peasant, I have no quarrel with you.  

P: You made it my business when you attacked these innocent creatures. 

*battle starts, ends*

Elf: Th-that was unbelievable! Thank you…hey wait, aren’t you…Oh, You Highness! *bows* Thank you for saving us. I do have some Aura power, but I admit my powers are mainly for healing rather than attacking. But if I may ask,  your Highness, why are so deep into the forest? 

P: Ah you see, this is Miss , and we are…

*explains their mission*

Elf: Oh, I see. *thinks very intensely, but quietly*

Y: Hey, is everything ok?

E: I do not wish to intrude, but please, if you can, let me come with you.

P: What?!

E: You see, I am tired of hiding and cowering in fear from those monsters. They cannot keep harming innocent creatures. I, I want to do something about it. I want to help.

P: *sigh* You seem very adamant about this. What do you think ___

Y: Well… *make a choice, yes or no*

*Elf will join party, or not*

P (Or E): The exit is just up ahead. Let’s go.
*exits forest, return to map screen for next area*
